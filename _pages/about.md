**About Me:**

I am a doctoral student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, under the guidance of Professors [Mikael Skoglund](https://people.kth.se/~skoglund/) and [Tobias Oechtering](https://www.kth.se/profile/oech). My doctoral research is supported by the [WASP Graduate School](https://wasp-sweden.org). Before my academic journey, I completed a double master's degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics from [KTH](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/applied-and-computational-mathematics/msc-applied-and-computational-mathematics-1.344221) and [École Polytechnique de Louvain](https://uclouvain.be/en/faculties/epl/mathematiques-appliquees.html) and a bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Electrical engineering at École Polytechnique de Louvain.  

My research interest lies at the confluence of Information Theory and Reinforcement Learning. Specifically, I am studying the performance of the Thompson Sampling algorithm for Multi-Armed Bandit Problems and Contextual Bandit Problems.
